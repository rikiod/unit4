**Week 33 (May 4th - May 11th):**

This week, we were assigned the task of looking through the first four sections of HTML/CSS on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). I found this task actually really fun and I enjoyed making the personal website. I'm looking forward to learn about more HTML and CSS tools. I had a few challenges with opening the HTML file on my computer, as well as with finding links of images to be directed to. However, I solved these issues. 

These two challenges left me with a question about the difference between "plain text" and "rich text," because that was the cause of my issue with opening the file on my laptop. Besides that, I also wonder how websites are hosted on servers and how the HTML and CSS works in that regard. I'm also curious as to how Javascript can be incorporated into websites.

**Week 34 (May 12th - 25th):**

This week (or two weeks), we had a lot of different tasks. This included programming exercises with Javascript and Python. We also thought more about our CS IA, and learned about computer networks. F

*Programming Exercises:* The Javascript programming exercises and CodingGame

*IA:* For the CS IA, I was thinking of approaching the ISAK main office to make an inventory system for the packages that come to the school. However, I've enjoyed what we've been doing with HTML and CSS, so now I am rethinking that and looking for other ideas as well. I also created a repository for the IA where I made files for all of the different criteria: I want to learn more about what each criteria entails so I looked through some example IAs on the internet too. 

*Computer Networks:* From [this video on computer networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QhU9jd03a0), I learned about the reduction of latency (the time it takes for a message to transfer), resulting in the growth of the global economy. Before the 1970s, most computers lacked a network connection. The video talked about carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) which is any shared transmission medium (ex. wires carrying ethernet or WiFi carrying radio waves); this data is then sent to a particular MAC address which every device has. The rate at which a carrier can transit data at is called bandwidth. The video also discussed how collisions of data occur when transmitted at the same time, so a procedure called exponential backoff is used to avoid those collisions. When the collision domain gets too large (too many devices on one network), however, these collisions become unavoidable. As such, network switches can be used to split up the domain into smaller subdomains. Routing is another important aspect to see which route the data should routed. One method is called circuit switching where the route is simply connected to the destination (ex. old time phone lines). Another strategy is message switching where data goes through a series of different locations before reaching its final destination, and the number of locations it goes through is called the "hop count." Large data is often split into smaller "packets" to minimize impact on networks. This approach, packet switching, is what the internet runs on today -- its decentralization is also important for security.
