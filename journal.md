**Week 33 (May 4th - May 11th):**

This week, we were assigned the task of looking through the first four sections of HTML/CSS on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). I found this task actually really fun and I enjoyed making the personal website. I'm looking forward to learn about more HTML and CSS tools. I had a few challenges with opening the HTML file on my computer, as well as with finding links of images to be directed to. However, I solved these issues. 

These two challenges left me with a question about the difference between "plain text" and "rich text," because that was the cause of my issue with opening the file on my laptop. Besides that, I also wonder how websites are hosted on servers and how the HTML and CSS works in that regard. I'm also curious as to how Javascript can be incorporated into websites.
